# awesome-books

"Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list. By building this application, I will learn how to manage data using JavaScript. Thanks to that my website will be more interactive. I will also use a medium-fidelity wireframe to build the UI.

## Built With

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Boilerplate for HTML
- Linters for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

In this project, we will build a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. We will achieve that by using JavaScript objects and arrays. We will also need to dynamically modify the DOM and add basic events this project is develop to Microverse curriculum.
